# JAB react native example project

This project uses `react-jab` for the app structure definitions and `native-base` as the components framework. The intention is to show the flexibility of jab, since it was not designed to work with any framework. Use this project as a base proyect or any way you want.

Just clone, and then

```
#install dependencies
$ yarn

#link just in case
$ react-native link

#start builder
$ yarn start

#build for ios and start simulator (mac osx)
$ yarn build-ios
```
